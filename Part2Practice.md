In Terminal, you are able to create files that are stored in your computer. Its also a place where you can delete files, move files to a different folder, and clone projects to your gitHub for grading or to have in your portfolio for the interview process. Here is a quick example of how to make a new directory in terminal.

## 1. Make Directory
```
mkdir created-file-demo
```
+ **mkdir**: the code used to make the new directory.
+ **Directory**: A directory is a folder that holds smaller files. 
+ **Dash symbol** - : is used to seperate the names of your file because the terminal will not allow you to use spaces it will create two seperate directorys instead.
+ **cd .** : Once youve made your new directory you will cd . into it so you can add some files.

***Example***:
```
mkdir created-file-demo
cd created-file-demo
```



## 2. Touch Files
To create a touch file inside of your directory you will need to first cd into the directory as demonstrated above and once you are in your new directory you will touch the file you want to create. Here's an example.
```
touch demo-in-a-demo
cd demo-in-a-demo
```
Now that you've created your file inside of your directory you can use that file to store anything you may need to save.

## 3. Removing Directories and Files

Removing a diectory and removing a file are essentially the same steps. 

### Removing a directory
```
rm -r created-file-demo
```
### Removing a file
```
rm demo-in-demo
```
***REMEMBER*** if you use this method to remove your directory and/or file it is **permanent**. It wil not go into a trash folder it will completely erase from your computer **forever** so be sure you are removing the right thing.

This was just a brief explanation of what the terminal can do for you if you would like more information on the terminal vist [macpaw](https://macpaw.com/how-to/use-terminal-on-mac?campaign=cmmx_search_dsa_us_en&ci=20156703004&adgroupid=149450658139&adpos=&ck=&targetid=dsa-2064653553349&match=&gnetwork=g&creative=658984727948&placement=&placecat=&accname=cmm&gad_source=1&gbraid=0AAAAADxMIddDsKy_Tq0TGlpgnOL2DuBKW&gclid=EAIaIQobChMI6Kbmn8ijiwMVPaFaBR2_BhzrEAAYASAAEgIAT_D_BwE)
